* `01-fetch-input-data` -> Python script that fetches comments from YouTube and stores them in a CSV file
* `02-rated-comments` -> Dataset of comments from my channel, marked as spam (1) or not spam (0)
* `03-tensorflow-training` -> Jupyter notebook used to train the text classifier with TensorFlow
* `04-inference` -> Python script that runs periodically to filter latest comments on my channel
